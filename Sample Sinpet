Subject: Request to Add Bank Group in MMS Form App

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention a suggestion for improving our MMS form app. Currently, we're sending bank and bank information separately, which can be a bit cumbersome. It would greatly streamline our process if we could have an option to include a bank group, where all relevant bank details are consolidated under one category.

Adding a bank group feature would enhance efficiency and organization within the app, making it easier for users to input and access bank information seamlessly.

Could you please look into the feasibility of incorporating this feature into the app? I believe it would significantly improve our workflow.

Thank you for considering my suggestion.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
