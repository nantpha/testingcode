**Subject: Re: New Features Implemented: Overall Call Duration Tracking and Separate First/Last Name Fields**

Hi [Recipient's Name],

Awesome, glad to hear you're excited about the new features!

I’ll block the calendar for a demo. How about [suggest a date and time]? Let me know if this works for you or if you have a preferred time.

Looking forward to it!

Best regards,

Replace `[Recipient's Name]`, `[suggest a date and time]`, `[Your First Name]`, `[Your Last Name]`, `[Your Position]`, and `[Your Contact Information]` with the appropriate details.



Thank you for your enthusiasm!

I’m glad to hear you’re excited about the new features. Let’s schedule a demo to go over the updates. How about [suggest a date and time]? Please let me know if this works for you or suggest an alternative time.

Looking forward to the demo!

**Subject: New Feature Implemented: Overall Call Duration Tracking**

Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well.

I am pleased to inform you that we have successfully implemented a new feature in our application to track the overall call duration for conversations. This feature has been merged into the development branch and is now available for testing.

### Key Updates:
- **Database Schema**: A new field has been added to store the total call duration.
- **Backend Logic**: The system now calculates and stores the call duration at the end of each call.
- **API Updates**: All relevant APIs have been updated to include the call duration data.
- **Frontend**: The UI has been updated to display the call duration in the conversation details.

### Next Steps:
1. **Testing**:
   - Please conduct thorough testing to ensure the new feature works as expected.
   - Report any issues or bugs in our tracking system.

2. **Documentation**:
   - The documentation has been updated to reflect these changes. Please review it [here](insert link to documentation).

3. **Feedback**:
   - We welcome your feedback on this new feature. Let us know if there are any additional enhancements or modifications needed.

Thank you for your attention to this update. Let’s ensure everything is working perfectly before we roll it out to production.

Best regards,

[Your Name]  
[Your Position]

Yes, you can write conditions in GraphQL queries using arguments, variables, and directives. Here's a brief overview of how each of these can be used to introduce conditions:

1. **Arguments**:
   You can pass arguments to fields to filter or conditionally fetch data.

   ```graphql
   query {
     users(active: true) {
       id
       name
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Variables**:
   You can use variables to dynamically change the values of arguments in your queries.

   ```graphql
   query GetUsers($isActive: Boolean!) {
     users(active: $isActive) {
       id
       name
     }
   }
   ```

   When you execute the query, you provide the value for `$isActive`:

   ```json
   {
     "isActive": true
   }
   ```

3. **Directives**:
   GraphQL provides built-in directives like `@include` and `@skip` to conditionally include or exclude fields based on boolean values.

   ```graphql
   query GetUsers($includeAddress: Boolean!) {
     users {
       id
       name
       address @include(if: $includeAddress)
     }
   }
   ```

   When you execute the query, you provide the value for `$includeAddress`:

   ```json
   {
     "includeAddress": true
   }
   ```

Here's an example using these concepts together:

```graphql
query GetUsers($isActive: Boolean!, $includeAddress: Boolean!) {
  users(active: $isActive) {
    id
    name
    address @include(if: $includeAddress)
  }
}
```

And the variables:

```json
{
  "isActive": true,
  "includeAddress": false
}
```

In this example, the query fetches users based on their active status and conditionally includes the address field based on the value of `$includeAddress`.
