Certainly! Hereâ€™s a way you could phrase your request:

"Hi [Recipient],

I just want to check with you on the process of onboarding our application to GKP. Could you provide some guidance or point me to the relevant resources?

Thank you!"

This is a clear and polite way to ask for the information you need.
