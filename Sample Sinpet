**Subject: Request for Dashboard to Monitor gRPC, Kubernetes, and Java Threads, Memory, and CPU Usage**

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. 

I am writing to request the development of a comprehensive dashboard for our application. Our application utilizes HTTP/2 and employs gRPC for communication. We would like to monitor various metrics to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization. Specifically, we need the dashboard to provide the following information:

1. **gRPC Metrics**:
   - Number of threads created by gRPC.

2. **Kubernetes Metrics**:
   - Number of threads created by Kubernetes.
   - Memory usage of Kubernetes pods.
   - CPU usage of Kubernetes pods.

3. **Java Application Metrics**:
   - Number of threads created by the Java application.
   - Memory usage of the Java application (heap and non-heap memory).
   - CPU usage of the Java application.

The dashboard should aggregate and display this data in real-time, providing us with actionable insights. It would be beneficial if the dashboard could offer visualization features such as graphs and alerts to help us quickly identify and respond to any issues.

Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification on the requirements. I am looking forward to your response and am available to discuss this further at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,

Subject: Request for Suggestion: Adding Bank Group in MMS Form App

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. Currently, in our MMS form app, we're sending bank and bank information separately, which can sometimes cause confusion and inefficiency. To streamline our process, I'm proposing the addition of a bank group feature, where all relevant bank details can be consolidated under one category.

I believe this enhancement would greatly improve user experience and simplify data entry. Before moving forward, I'd like to gather your insights and suggestions on how best to implement this feature. 

Could you please share your thoughts on integrating a bank group into our MMS form app? Any ideas or feedback you have would be greatly appreciated.

Looking forward to hearing from you.
