Let's go through a complete example of how to write a custom load balancer (or partitioner) for Kafka, which routes messages based on a specific logic. In this case, we'll design a partitioner that routes messages with specific `customerID` values to dedicated partitions, while distributing others evenly across the remaining partitions.

### Scenario
You have a Kafka topic named `customer-orders`. You want to route messages to partitions based on the following rules:
- **Customer IDs that are divisible by 5** should always go to partition 0.
- **Customer IDs that are not divisible by 5** should be evenly distributed across the remaining partitions.

### Step 1: Implementing the Custom Partitioner in Java

First, create a custom partitioner class that implements Kafka's `Partitioner` interface.

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.Partitioner;
import org.apache.kafka.common.Cluster;

import java.util.Map;

public class CustomCustomerPartitioner implements Partitioner {

    @Override
    public void configure(Map<String, ?> configs) {
        // Configuration can be handled here, if needed
    }

    @Override
    public int partition(String topic, Object key, byte[] keyBytes, Object value, byte[] valueBytes, Cluster cluster) {
        int numPartitions = cluster.partitionCountForTopic(topic); // Get the number of partitions for the topic

        if (key instanceof String) { // Ensure the key is a String
            String customerID = (String) key;
            int id = Integer.parseInt(customerID); // Parse the customer ID as an integer
            
            // Custom logic to determine the partition
            if (id % 5 == 0) {
                return 0;  // Route to partition 0 for customer IDs divisible by 5
            } else {
                // Distribute other IDs across remaining partitions (1 to numPartitions-1)
                return (id % (numPartitions - 1)) + 1;  // Ensures partition 0 is excluded
            }
        }

        // Fallback to default partitioning (if key is not as expected)
        return key.hashCode() % numPartitions;
    }

    @Override
    public void close() {
        // Close resources if any, typically not needed
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Configuring the Kafka Producer to Use the Custom Partitioner

Next, configure your Kafka producer to use this custom partitioner. Here's an example of how you can set up the producer.

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;

import java.util.Properties;

public class CustomKafkaProducer {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Producer configuration settings
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092"); // Kafka broker
        props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer"); // Key serializer
        props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, "org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer"); // Value serializer
        props.put(ProducerConfig.PARTITIONER_CLASS_CONFIG, "com.example.kafka.CustomCustomerPartitioner"); // Custom partitioner

        KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);

        // Example data to send to Kafka
        String[] customerIDs = {"10", "11", "15", "22", "25"};
        for (String customerID : customerIDs) {
            String value = "Order data for customer ID " + customerID;
            ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>("customer-orders", customerID, value);
            producer.send(record); // Send the record
        }

        producer.close(); // Close the producer to flush and close resources
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Deploying and Testing

1. **Deploy the Application**: Compile and run your Java application.
2. **Monitor Kafka Partitions**: Use Kafka tools like `kafka-console-consumer` or `kafka-topics` to monitor which partition each message ends up in.
3. **Validate**:
   - Messages with `customerID` values like `10`, `15`, `25` should all be routed to **partition 0**.
   - Messages with `customerID` values like `11`, `22` should be distributed across **partitions 1, 2, ..., n** based on the partitioning logic.

### Advantages of This Custom Partitioner
- **Tailored Data Distribution**: You can precisely control how messages are distributed across partitions.
- **Optimized Performance**: By routing specific customers to dedicated partitions, you can optimize performance for those customers.

### Disadvantages of This Custom Partitioner
- **Increased Complexity**: Custom logic adds complexity to your Kafka setup and requires more maintenance.
- **Potential for Imbalance**: If not carefully managed, some partitions could become overloaded, leading to imbalanced performance.

This approach gives you the flexibility to implement advanced routing logic in Kafka, ensuring that your messages are processed in a way that meets your application's specific needs.











Writing your own load balancer for Kafka topics can give you greater control over how data is distributed across partitions, but it also comes with challenges. Here's an overview of what you should consider:

### Key Considerations for Writing Your Own Kafka Load Balancer

1. **Partitioning Strategy**:
   - Decide how to assign messages to partitions. Kafka's default partitioning can be based on a key (hash-based) or round-robin. You might need a custom strategy based on message content, time-based partitions, or other criteria.
   - Ensure that your strategy aligns with your ordering and performance requirements.

2. **Data Distribution**:
   - Ensure even data distribution across partitions to prevent hot spots. Consider factors like message size and frequency.
   - Implement mechanisms to detect and correct data skew.

3. **Dynamic Rebalancing**:
   - Design your load balancer to handle dynamic rebalancing when brokers or partitions are added or removed.
   - Implement strategies to minimize disruption during rebalancing, such as throttling or staggered rebalancing.

4. **Monitoring and Metrics**:
   - Implement detailed monitoring to track how well your load balancer is performing. Track metrics such as partition load, message latency, and throughput.
   - Use this data to fine-tune your balancing strategy.

5. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Ensure that your load balancer can handle broker failures gracefully. Implement redundancy or fallback mechanisms.
   - Consider the impact of partition leader changes on your load balancing logic.

6. **Integration with Kafka Clients**:
   - Your load balancer needs to integrate seamlessly with Kafka producers. This might involve modifying the producer’s code or developing a middleware layer.
   - Ensure compatibility with Kafka’s producer API, especially if you’re using features like transactions or idempotent producers.

7. **Scalability**:
   - Design your load balancer to scale with your Kafka cluster. As the number of partitions and topics grows, your load balancer should remain efficient.
   - Consider distributed load balancing if your Kafka cluster spans multiple data centers or regions.

8. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Thoroughly test your load balancer under different load conditions to ensure it behaves as expected.
   - Validate that your custom partitioning strategy doesn’t introduce unintended consequences like data loss or increased latency.

9. **Compatibility and Maintenance**:
   - Keep up with Kafka updates and ensure that your load balancer remains compatible with future Kafka versions.
   - Consider the maintenance burden of supporting a custom load balancer over time.

### Advantages of Writing Your Own Load Balancer

- **Customization**: Tailor the load balancing logic to fit your specific use case, optimizing performance and resource utilization.
- **Control**: Full control over data distribution, allowing for advanced features like time-based partitioning or content-based routing.

### Disadvantages of Writing Your Own Load Balancer

- **Complexity**: Developing and maintaining a custom load balancer adds complexity to your system.
- **Maintenance Overhead**: You’ll need to ensure ongoing support, especially when Kafka is updated or when your system’s requirements change.
- **Potential for Errors**: Custom implementations can introduce bugs or performance issues, especially if not thoroughly tested.

By writing your own load balancer, you can address specific requirements that Kafka’s default partitioning and load balancing mechanisms might not handle. However, weigh the benefits against the complexity and potential maintenance burden.

Apache Kafka itself does not come with a built-in load balancer, as Kafka is designed to handle load distribution across brokers using its own mechanisms. However, there are several strategies and external tools that can be used to load balance Kafka clients and distribute traffic across Kafka brokers effectively:

### 1. **Kafka's Internal Load Balancing**
   - **Partitioning**: Kafka topics are divided into partitions, and each partition can be assigned to different brokers. Kafka producers can send messages to specific partitions based on a partitioning strategy (e.g., round-robin, hash-based on key, custom partitioners).
   - **Consumer Group Balancing**: Kafka consumers in a consumer group automatically balance partitions among themselves. If a new consumer joins the group, Kafka rebalances the partitions across all consumers.

### 2. **Client-Side Load Balancing**
   - **Producer Clients**: Kafka producers can be configured to distribute messages across partitions. By default, if a key is provided, Kafka will hash the key to determine the partition. Without a key, producers often use round-robin to distribute messages across available partitions.
   - **Consumer Clients**: Consumers automatically handle load balancing at the partition level. If you have multiple consumers in a group, Kafka assigns different partitions to different consumers.

### 3. **External Load Balancers**
   - **HAProxy or NGINX**: These can be used to balance the connection requests between Kafka clients and brokers. Typically, this is used to distribute the load when clients need to connect to Kafka brokers without being aware of the broker details.
     - **HAProxy**: Can be configured to distribute requests across Kafka brokers using algorithms like round-robin, least connections, etc.
     - **NGINX**: Can similarly route traffic, though it is less commonly used for Kafka compared to HAProxy.

### 4. **DNS Load Balancing**
   - **DNS Round Robin**: Can be used to distribute connection requests to Kafka brokers by assigning multiple IPs (of different Kafka brokers) to a single DNS name. However, this approach is basic and does not provide health checks or dynamic load balancing based on broker status.

### 5. **Zookeeper Load Balancing**
   - **Kafka uses Zookeeper for broker discovery**: Clients can query Zookeeper to get the list of available brokers and then implement their own logic to choose a broker. This is often done in large deployments where a custom client-side load balancing strategy is implemented.

### 6. **Kafka Load Balancer Tools**
   - **Kafka Load Balancer (KLB)**: Some Kafka deployments use tools like Kafka Load Balancer (KLB), a specialized tool designed to balance producer load across brokers. This is more of a niche solution and is typically used in large-scale or specific environments.

### Considerations for Kafka Load Balancing:
- **Network Latency**: Ensure that the load balancer does not introduce significant latency, which could affect Kafka's performance.
- **Broker Health**: Some external load balancers can be configured to perform health checks on brokers to avoid sending traffic to unhealthy or overloaded brokers.
- **Security**: When using external load balancers, ensure they are configured to handle the security requirements of Kafka, such as SSL/TLS encryption and authentication.

While Kafka is quite effective at balancing load internally, using external load balancers or client-side strategies can further optimize performance, especially in large, complex environments.

In Kafka, if a consumer receives a message that is not intended for it (e.g., the message belongs to another pod or service), you have a few options:

### 1. **Forwarding the Message to Another Topic or Partition:**
   - You can forward the message to another Kafka topic or partition that is consumed by the correct pod. This can be done by producing the message to the new topic or partition.
   - This approach requires that you have a mechanism in place to determine the correct topic or partition to which the message should be forwarded.

   ```java
   // Example of forwarding a message to another topic
   KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);
   ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>("new-topic", key, value);
   producer.send(record);
   producer.close();
   ```

### 2. **Rejecting the Message:**
   - Kafka consumers do not natively support rejecting or "nacking" a message like some other message brokers (e.g., RabbitMQ).
   - However, you can implement custom logic to handle messages that are not utilized by the current pod. For example, you could log these messages, store them in a database, or produce them to a "dead letter" topic for further analysis.

   ```java
   // Example of producing a message to a dead letter topic
   KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);
   ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>("dead-letter-topic", key, value);
   producer.send(record);
   producer.close();
   ```

### 3. **Filtering Messages Before Processing:**
   - If your consumers are capable of filtering messages before processing them, you could implement a filtering mechanism based on the message's content or metadata. Messages that don't pass the filter can be ignored or handled according to your application's requirements.

   ```java
   if (messageBelongsToThisPod(record)) {
       // Process the message
   } else {
       // Ignore or forward the message
   }
   ```

### 4. **Rebalancing Consumers:**
   - Ensure that your Kafka consumer group is correctly configured so that messages are only consumed by the appropriate pods. Rebalancing your consumers or adjusting your partitioning strategy might be necessary to ensure that each pod only receives the messages it should process.

### 5. **Using Headers for Routing:**
   - If your Kafka messages contain headers, you could use these headers to determine whether the message should be processed by the current pod. If the message isn't for the current pod, you can handle it accordingly (e.g., by forwarding it or discarding it).

   ```java
   String headerValue = record.headers().lastHeader("target-pod").value().toString();
   if (headerValue.equals("current-pod")) {
       // Process the message
   } else {
       // Forward or ignore the message
   }
   ```

Choosing the right approach depends on your specific use case and architecture. If you need more specific guidance, feel free to provide additional details!

If you're building a custom load balancer for a consumer-facing Spring Boot application, the process involves similar steps but with additional considerations. The consumer app might be consuming services from multiple instances of a microservice, and you want to distribute the load efficiently.

Here's how you can approach it:

### 1. **Dependencies**:
   Ensure your Spring Boot application includes the necessary dependencies. If you're using Spring Cloud for load balancing, add the following dependencies to your `pom.xml`:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-loadbalancer</artifactId>
   </dependency>
   ```

### 2. **Define Custom Load Balancer**:
   Create a custom load balancer that implements your preferred load balancing strategy (e.g., Round Robin, Least Connections).

   Here's an example of a custom load balancer using Round Robin strategy:

   ```java
   import org.springframework.cloud.client.ServiceInstance;
   import org.springframework.cloud.client.loadbalancer.LoadBalancerClient;
   import org.springframework.cloud.client.loadbalancer.LoadBalancerRequest;
   import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

   import java.util.List;
   import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;

   @Component
   public class CustomLoadBalancer implements LoadBalancerClient {

       private final AtomicInteger position = new AtomicInteger(0);
       private final List<ServiceInstance> instances;

       public CustomLoadBalancer(List<ServiceInstance> instances) {
           this.instances = instances;
       }

       @Override
       public ServiceInstance choose(String serviceId) {
           int pos = position.getAndIncrement() % instances.size();
           return instances.get(pos);
       }

       @Override
       public <T> T execute(String serviceId, ServiceInstance serviceInstance, LoadBalancerRequest<T> request) {
           try {
               return request.apply(serviceInstance);
           } catch (Exception e) {
               throw new RuntimeException(e);
           }
       }

       @Override
       public URI reconstructURI(ServiceInstance instance, URI original) {
           return instance.getUri();
       }
   }
   ```

### 3. **Service Discovery**:
   If your microservices are registered with a service discovery tool like Eureka, you can fetch the service instances dynamically. Modify the custom load balancer to use service discovery:

   ```java
   import org.springframework.cloud.client.discovery.DiscoveryClient;
   import org.springframework.cloud.client.ServiceInstance;
   import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

   @Component
   public class CustomLoadBalancer {

       private final DiscoveryClient discoveryClient;
       private final AtomicInteger position = new AtomicInteger(0);

       public CustomLoadBalancer(DiscoveryClient discoveryClient) {
           this.discoveryClient = discoveryClient;
       }

       public ServiceInstance choose(String serviceId) {
           List<ServiceInstance> instances = discoveryClient.getInstances(serviceId);
           if (instances.isEmpty()) {
               return null;
           }
           int pos = position.getAndIncrement() % instances.size();
           return instances.get(pos);
       }
   }
   ```

### 4. **Configure and Use the Custom Load Balancer**:
   Use your custom load balancer in the consumer app's business logic to distribute requests:

   ```java
   import org.springframework.cloud.client.ServiceInstance;
   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
   import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

   @RestController
   public class ConsumerController {

       private final CustomLoadBalancer customLoadBalancer;

       public ConsumerController(CustomLoadBalancer customLoadBalancer) {
           this.customLoadBalancer = customLoadBalancer;
       }

       @GetMapping("/consume")
       public String consumeService() {
           ServiceInstance instance = customLoadBalancer.choose("my-service");
           if (instance == null) {
               return "No instances available";
           }
           // Example of using RestTemplate to forward request to the chosen instance
           String uri = instance.getUri().toString() + "/service-endpoint";
           RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
           return restTemplate.getForObject(uri, String.class);
       }
   }
   ```

### 5. **Testing and Optimization**:
   Test your consumer app thoroughly to ensure that the load balancing works as expected. Monitor the performance and optimize your custom logic if needed. Consider adding retries and fallback mechanisms to handle instances that might become unavailable.

### 6. **Additional Considerations**:
   - **Circuit Breaker:** Implement a circuit breaker pattern to manage instances that are down or responding slowly.
   - **Health Checks:** Regularly check the health of instances before directing traffic to them.
   - **Dynamic Configuration:** Make your load balancer configuration dynamic by using a configuration management tool like Spring Cloud Config.

This custom load balancer will allow your consumer app to distribute load efficiently across multiple instances, ensuring better performance and reliability.





To create a simple Spring Boot application that interacts with a file in a NAS (Network Attached Storage) and appends data to it, you can follow these steps. Below is a basic example:

### Step 1: Set Up Your Spring Boot Project

1. **Create a new Spring Boot project**:
   - You can use [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) to generate a new Spring Boot project. Select the necessary dependencies like `Spring Web` and `Spring Boot DevTools`.

2. **Project Structure**:
   Ensure your project structure is similar to this:

   ```
   src/
   ├── main/
   │   ├── java/
   │   │   └── com/
   │   │       └── example/
   │   │           └── nasfile/
   │   │               ├── NasFileApplication.java
   │   │               └── controller/
   │   │                   └── FileController.java
   │   └── resources/
   │       └── application.properties
   └── test/
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Access to NAS in `application.properties`

In the `application.properties` file, configure the path to your NAS:

```properties
nas.file.path=//NAS_SERVER/your_shared_folder/your_file.txt
```

Replace `//NAS_SERVER/your_shared_folder/your_file.txt` with the actual path to your NAS file.

### Step 3: Create the Spring Boot Application

In `NasFileApplication.java`:

```java
package com.example.nasfile;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class NasFileApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(NasFileApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### Step 4: Create a Controller to Append Data to the File

In `controller/FileController.java`:

```java
package com.example.nasfile.controller;

import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Value;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/file")
public class FileController {

    @Value("${nas.file.path}")
    private String nasFilePath;

    @PostMapping("/append")
    public String appendToFile(@RequestParam String data) {
        Path path = Paths.get(nasFilePath);
        try {
            // Ensure the file exists
            if (!Files.exists(path)) {
                Files.createFile(path);
            }

            // Append data to the file
            try (FileWriter writer = new FileWriter(path.toFile(), true)) {
                writer.write(data + System.lineSeparator());
            }

            return "Data appended successfully!";
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            return "Error while appending data to the file: " + e.getMessage();
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 5: Test the Application

Run your Spring Boot application and use a tool like `Postman` or `curl` to test the endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/file/append -d "data=This is some data to append"
```

This will append the provided data to the file on your NAS.

### Summary

- You created a Spring Boot application with a controller that interacts with a file on a NAS.
- The application appends data to the file based on HTTP POST requests.

This is a simple example, and in a real-world scenario, you'd need to handle more advanced concerns such as error handling, authentication, and proper file locking mechanisms.

To create a Spring Boot 3.2.2 application with a gRPC server in a Maven project, follow these steps:

### 1. **Set Up Your Maven Project:**
First, create a new Maven project or modify an existing one by adding the necessary dependencies in your `pom.xml` file.

### 2. **Add Dependencies:**
Add the following dependencies for Spring Boot, gRPC, and protobuf in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<properties>
    <java.version>17</java.version> <!-- Java version -->
    <spring-boot.version>3.2.2</spring-boot.version> <!-- Spring Boot version -->
    <grpc.version>1.58.0</grpc.version> <!-- gRPC version -->
    <protobuf.version>3.21.7</protobuf.version> <!-- Protobuf version -->
</properties>

<dependencies>
    <!-- Spring Boot Starter -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    
    <!-- gRPC Starter -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>net.devh</groupId>
        <artifactId>grpc-server-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
        <version>${grpc.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    
    <!-- Protobuf and gRPC -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
        <artifactId>grpc-protobuf</artifactId>
        <version>${grpc.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>

        <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
        <artifactId>grpc-stub</artifactId>
        <version>${grpc.version}</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.google.protobuf</groupId>
        <artifactId>protobuf-java</artifactId>
        <version>${protobuf.version}</version>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Other dependencies (e.g., Lombok, etc.) -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
        <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

<build>
    <plugins>
        <!-- Spring Boot Maven Plugin -->
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>

        <!-- Protobuf Plugin -->
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.xolstice.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>protobuf-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>0.6.1</version>
            <configuration>
                <protocArtifact>com.google.protobuf:protoc:${protobuf.version}:exe:${os.detected.classifier}</protocArtifact>

                    </goals>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

### 3. **Create Your Protobuf File:**
Define your gRPC service and messages in a `.proto` file. For example, create a `src/main/proto/helloworld.proto` file:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

option java_multiple_files = true;
option java_package = "com.example.grpc";
option java_outer_classname = "HelloWorldProto";

package helloworld;

// The greeting service definition.
service Greeter {
  // Sends a greeting
  rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {}
}

// The request message containing the user's name.
message HelloRequest {
  string name = 1;
}

// The response message containing the greetings.
message HelloReply {
  string message = 1;
}
```

### 4. **Generate gRPC Classes:**
Run `mvn clean install` to generate the gRPC classes from your `.proto` file. This will generate Java files based on the protobuf definitions in the `target/generated-sources/protobuf` directory.

### 5. **Implement the gRPC Service:**
Create a new class to implement your gRPC service, for example:

```java
package com.example.grpc;

import io.grpc.stub.StreamObserver;
import net.devh.boot.grpc.server.service.GrpcService;

@GrpcService
public class GreeterService extends GreeterGrpc.GreeterImplBase {

    @Override
    public void sayHello(HelloRequest request, StreamObserver<HelloReply> responseObserver) {
        HelloReply reply = HelloReply.newBuilder()
            .setMessage("Hello, " + request.getName())
            .build();
        responseObserver.onNext(reply);
        responseObserver.onCompleted();
    }
}
```

### 6. **Application Configuration:**
Spring Boot will automatically configure and start your gRPC server when you run the application.

### 7. **Run the Application:**
Run your Spring Boot application using:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 8. **Client Side:**
You can create a client in Java or another language to test the gRPC server.

This setup should get you started with a Spring Boot 3.2.2 application running a gRPC server. If you encounter any specific issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!
If you have multiple pods consuming from the same Kafka topic and you want to ensure that messages for the same user (same user ID) are handled by the same pod, you can rely on Kafka's partitioning and consumer group mechanisms. However, if you want to explicitly differentiate between pods for the same user ID subscription and ensure that a specific pod handles a specific user's messages, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Use User ID as Key**:
    Ensure that you are using the user ID as the key when producing messages. This ensures that all messages for the same user go to the same partition.

2. **Ensure Single Consumer for Each Partition**:
    Kafka's consumer group mechanism ensures that each partition is consumed by only one consumer within the same consumer group. This means that as long as the number of consumers (pods) does not exceed the number of partitions, each partition will be handled by a single pod.

3. **Configure Consumer Group**:
    All your pods should be part of the same consumer group to allow Kafka to assign partitions to the available pods.

### Example Implementation:

#### Producer Code
When producing messages, use the user ID as the key:

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer;
import java.util.Properties;

public class StickySessionProducer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        props.put(ProducerConfig.KEY_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName());
        props.put(ProducerConfig.VALUE_SERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringSerializer.class.getName());

        KafkaProducer<String, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props);

        String userId = "user123"; // Example user ID
        String topic = "user-topic";
        String value = "some message for user";

        ProducerRecord<String, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>(topic, userId, value);
        producer.send(record);

        producer.close();
    }
}
```

#### Consumer Code
Ensure that all consumer instances (pods) are part of the same consumer group and handle partition assignment appropriately:

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecords;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer;

import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Properties;

public class StickySessionConsumer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, "user-session-group"); // Same group ID for all consumers
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class.getName());
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class.getName());

        KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
        consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList("user-topic"));

        while (true) {
            ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(100);
            for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
                System.out.printf("Consumed record with key %s and value %s%n", record.key(), record.value());
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### Deploy Consumers in Kubernetes
Deploy your consumer application in Kubernetes, ensuring that all pods are part of the same consumer group:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: kafka-consumer
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: kafka-consumer
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: kafka-consumer
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: kafka-consumer
          image: your-consumer-image
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```

### Ensuring Correct Partition Assignment

Kafka will automatically assign partitions to consumers in the same group, ensuring each partition is handled by one consumer at a time. If you have more consumers than partitions, some consumers will be idle. If you have more partitions than consumers, some consumers will handle multiple partitions.

To ensure correct handling:

- **Number of Partitions**: Ensure you have enough partitions to distribute the load evenly among your consumers.
- **Idempotent Processing**: Ensure your message processing is idempotent to handle potential rebalancing gracefully.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that each user’s messages are handled by a specific consumer pod, achieving the desired sticky session behavior.


To ensure that a specific consumer instance (or pod) handles messages from a particular partition, even when your consumer application is deployed in multiple clusters or pods, you can leverage Kafka's consumer group and partition assignment mechanism. Here's how you can achieve this:

1. **Consumer Group**: All your consumer instances (pods) should belong to the same consumer group. Kafka will automatically assign partitions to consumers in the same group to ensure that each partition is consumed by only one consumer instance at a time.

2. **Partition Assignment**: When a new consumer joins the group or an existing consumer leaves, Kafka will rebalance the partitions among the available consumers in the group. This ensures that each partition is consumed by exactly one consumer.

3. **Sticky Session Simulation**: By using the user ID or session ID as the key for messages, you ensure that all messages for the same user go to the same partition. Kafka's consumer group mechanism will then ensure that the same consumer instance (pod) handles all messages for that partition.

Here's a high-level overview of the steps to configure your consumers:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Configure the Kafka Consumer**:
    Ensure that all consumer instances (pods) are part of the same consumer group.

    ```java
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerConfig;
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer;
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecords;
    import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord;
    import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer;

    import java.util.Collections;
    import java.util.Properties;

    public class StickySessionConsumer {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Properties props = new Properties();
            props.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
            props.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, "user-session-group"); // Same group ID for all consumers
            props.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class.getName());
            props.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class.getName());

            KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
            consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList("user-topic"));

            while (true) {
                ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(100);
                for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
                    System.out.printf("Consumed record with key %s and value %s%n", record.key(), record.value());
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

2. **Deploy the Consumers in Kubernetes**:
    When deploying your consumer application in Kubernetes, you can scale the deployment to multiple pods. Each pod will be part of the same consumer group.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: kafka-consumer
    spec:
      replicas: 3
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          app: kafka-consumer
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            app: kafka-consumer
        spec:
          containers:
            - name: kafka-consumer
              image: your-consumer-image
              ports:
                - containerPort: 8080
    ```

3. **Ensure Single Partition Ownership**:
    Kafka's consumer group mechanism will ensure that each partition is consumed by only one consumer instance. This means that all messages for a specific user (same key) will be processed by the same pod as long as the number of consumers does not exceed the number of partitions.

4. **Handling Rebalancing**:
    Be aware that rebalancing can occur if a consumer pod crashes or a new consumer pod is added. Kafka will reassign partitions to the available consumers. Your consumer logic should be idempotent and able to handle reprocessing of messages if necessary.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your consumer application handles messages in a way that simulates sticky sessions, even when deployed across multiple clusters or pods in Kubernetes. Each user’s messages will be processed by a single pod, thanks to Kafka's partitioning and consumer group mechanisms.
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.KafkaConsumer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecords;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer;

import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Properties;

public class StickySessionConsumer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, "user-session-group"); // Same group ID for all consumers
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class.getName());
        props.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class.getName());

        KafkaConsumer<String, String> consumer = new KafkaConsumer<>(props);
        consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList("user-topic"));

        while (true) {
            ConsumerRecords<String, String> records = consumer.poll(100);
            for (ConsumerRecord<String, String> record : records) {
                System.out.printf("Consumed record with key %s and value %s%n", record.key(), record.value());
            }
        }
    }
}

Subject: Issue with Receiving gRPC Events in Spring Boot Application

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

We are currently encountering an issue with our Spring Boot application, which uses gRPC. Despite our memory and CPU usage being below 59%, we are experiencing problems with receiving gRPC events from the client in GKP (Google Kubernetes Engine). 

The application does not seem to accept the requests from the client, and we have been unable to identify the root cause of this issue.

Could you please assist us in diagnosing and resolving this problem? Any insights or recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,

Feel free to adjust the details as needed.



Let's go through a more detailed step-by-step process to ensure everything is set up correctly.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create a New Spring Boot Project:**

   Use Spring Initializr to create a new project with the necessary dependencies.
   - Visit [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/).
   - Project: Maven
   - Language: Java
   - Spring Boot: Latest stable version
   - Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Boot DevTools

2. **Add gRPC Dependencies:**

   Update your `pom.xml` file to include the necessary dependencies for gRPC and Protobuf:

   ```xml
   <dependencies>
       <!-- Spring Boot Starter -->
       <dependency>
           <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
           <artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
       </dependency>

       <!-- gRPC dependencies -->
       <dependency>
           <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
           <artifactId>grpc-netty-shaded</artifactId>
           <version>1.48.0</version>
       </dependency>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
           <artifactId>grpc-protobuf</artifactId>
           <version>1.48.0</version>
       </dependency>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>io.grpc</groupId>
           <artifactId>grpc-stub</artifactId>
           <version>1.48.0</version>
       </dependency>

       <!-- Protobuf dependencies -->
       <dependency>
           <groupId>com.google.protobuf</groupId>
           <artifactId>protobuf-java</artifactId>
           <version>3.21.7</version>
       </dependency>

       <!-- gRPC Spring Boot Starter -->

       </dependency>
   </dependencies>

   <build>
       <extensions>
           <extension>
               <groupId>kr.motd.maven</groupId>
               <artifactId>os-maven-plugin</artifactId>

                           <goal>compile</goal>
                           <goal>compile-custom</goal>
                           <goal>test-compile</goal>
                           <goal>test-compile-custom</goal>
                       </goals>
                   </execution>
               </executions>
           </plugin>
       </plugins>
   </build>
   ```

3. **Define the gRPC Service using Protocol Buffers:**

   Create a `.proto` file in `src/main/proto/helloworld.proto`:

   ```proto
   syntax = "proto3";

   option java_multiple_files = true;
   option java_package = "com.example.grpc";
   option java_outer_classname = "HelloWorldProto";

   service Greeter {
     rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply);
   }

   message HelloRequest {
     string name = 1;
   }

   message HelloReply {
     string message = 1;
   }
   ```

4. **Implement the gRPC Service:**

   Create a class that implements the generated gRPC service. For example, `HelloWorldService.java`:

   ```java
   package com.example.grpc;

   import io.grpc.stub.StreamObserver;
   import org.lognet.springboot.grpc.GRpcService;

   @GRpcService
   public class HelloWorldService extends GreeterGrpc.GreeterImplBase {

       @Override
       public void sayHello(HelloRequest request, StreamObserver<HelloReply> responseObserver) {
           HelloReply reply = HelloReply.newBuilder()
               .setMessage("Hello " + request.getName())
               .build();
           responseObserver.onNext(reply);
           responseObserver.onCompleted();
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Configure Spring Boot for gRPC:**

   Ensure the `application.properties` file contains the necessary logging configuration and gRPC port configuration:

   ```properties
   grpc.server.port=9090
   logging.level.root=INFO
   logging.level.org.springframework=INFO
   logging.level.com.example=DEBUG
   logging.level.io.grpc=DEBUG
   ```

6. **Main Application Class:**

   Create a main application class to run your Spring Boot application:

   ```java
   package com.example.grpc;

   import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
   import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

   @SpringBootApplication
   public class GrpcApplication {

       public static void main(String[] args) {
           SpringApplication.run(GrpcApplication.class, args);
       }
   }
   ```

7. **Build and Run:**

   Ensure your project is built correctly. Run the following commands from your project root to clean and build:

   ```sh
   ./mvnw clean install
   ```

   Then, run your application again:

   ```sh
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

8. **Check Logs:**

   Upon successful startup, you should see logs indicating that the gRPC server has started. Look for entries similar to:

   ```
   [INFO] [main] o.l.s.g.GrpcServerRunner - Starting gRPC Server ...
   [INFO] [main] o.l.s.g.GrpcServerRunner - gRPC Server started, listening on address: *, port: 9090
   ```

If you still do not see any gRPC-related logs, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Ensure no other applications are running on port 9090.
- Verify that the `@GRpcService` annotation is correctly applied to your service implementation.
- Check for any exceptions or errors in the logs that might indicate why the gRPC server is not starting.
- Ensure the correct versions of all dependencies are being used and that there are no conflicts.

Let me know if you encounter any specific errors or issues during this process.

When deciding between using partition or offset values in Kafka to manage message consumption, it's important to understand the use cases and benefits of each:

1. **Partition**:
   - **Use Case**: Partitions are used to ensure message ordering and parallelism. By consuming from specific partitions, you ensure that the order of messages within those partitions is preserved. This is crucial for applications that rely on the sequence of messages.
   - **Best for**: Ensuring message order, load balancing, and parallel processing.

2. **Offset**:
   - **Use Case**: Offsets are used to track the position of consumption within a partition. Offsets allow you to start consuming from a specific point, which is useful for replaying messages or recovering from a failure.
   - **Best for**: Precise control over message consumption, such as starting from a specific point or resuming after a failure.

### Combining Both: Best Practices

In practice, using both partition and offset can provide the most control and flexibility. Here’s how you can use both effectively in a Spring Kafka consumer:

### Configuring Consumer for Specific Offsets

To consume messages starting from a specific offset in a partition, you can use a `SeekToCurrentErrorHandler` or manually seek to the desired offset using a `ConsumerRebalanceListener`.

#### Example: Using ConsumerRebalanceListener

1. **Configure Kafka Consumer Factory and Container Factory**:

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.OffsetResetStrategy;
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.EnableKafka;
import org.springframework.kafka.config.ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.ConsumerFactory;
import org.springframework.kafka.core.DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory;
import org.springframework.kafka.listener.config.ContainerProperties;

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

@EnableKafka
@Configuration
public class KafkaConsumerConfig {

    @Bean
    public ConsumerFactory<String, String> consumerFactory() {
        Map<String, Object> config = new HashMap<>();

        config.put(ConsumerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, "localhost:9092");
        config.put(ConsumerConfig.GROUP_ID_CONFIG, "audio-group");
        config.put(ConsumerConfig.KEY_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class);
        config.put(ConsumerConfig.VALUE_DESERIALIZER_CLASS_CONFIG, StringDeserializer.class);
        config.put(ConsumerConfig.AUTO_OFFSET_RESET_CONFIG, OffsetResetStrategy.EARLIEST.name().toLowerCase());

        return new DefaultKafkaConsumerFactory<>(config);
    }

    @Bean
    public ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<String, String> kafkaListenerContainerFactory() {
        ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<String, String> factory = 
                new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory<>();
        factory.setConsumerFactory(consumerFactory());
        factory.getContainerProperties().setAckMode(ContainerProperties.AckMode.MANUAL_IMMEDIATE);
        return factory;
    }
}
```

2. **Create a Kafka Listener with Offset Management**:

```java
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.Consumer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.consumer.ConsumerRebalanceListener;
import org.apache.kafka.common.TopicPartition;
import org.springframework.kafka.annotation.KafkaListener;
import org.springframework.kafka.listener.AcknowledgingMessageListener;
import org.springframework.kafka.support.Acknowledgment;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

import java.util.Base64;
import java.util.Collection;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;

@Service
public class AudioKafkaConsumer {

    private final Map<TopicPartition, Long> offsets = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

    @KafkaListener(topics = "audio-topic", groupId = "audio-group", containerFactory = "kafkaListenerContainerFactory")
    public void consume(ConsumerRecord<String, String> record, Acknowledgment acknowledgment, Consumer<?, ?> consumer) {
        String base64AudioString = record.value();
        
        // Decode Base64 string to byte array
        byte[] audioBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(base64AudioString);

        // Process the audio bytes as needed
        processAudioBytes(audioBytes);

        // Manually acknowledge the message
        acknowledgment.acknowledge();

        // Save offset
        offsets.put(new TopicPartition(record.topic(), record.partition()), record.offset() + 1);
    }

    private void processAudioBytes(byte[] audioBytes) {
        // Implement your audio processing logic here
        System.out.println("Received audio bytes of length: " + audioBytes.length);
        
        // For example, save to a file or play the audio
    }

    private ConsumerRebalanceListener getRebalanceListener(Consumer<?, ?> consumer) {
        return new ConsumerRebalanceListener() {
            @Override
            public void onPartitionsRevoked(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions) {
                // Save current offsets to storage (e.g., database)
            }

            @Override
            public void onPartitionsAssigned(Collection<TopicPartition> partitions) {
                // Seek to the last committed offset
                for (TopicPartition partition : partitions) {
                    Long offset = offsets.get(partition);
                    if (offset != null) {
                        consumer.seek(partition, offset);
                    } else {
                        consumer.seekToBeginning(partitions);
                    }
                }
            }
        };
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **ConsumerRebalanceListener**: This listener handles partition reassignments. When partitions are assigned, it seeks to the last committed offset. This ensures that the consumer starts from the correct offset after a rebalance.
- **Manual Offset Management**: The consumer saves the current offset after processing each record. This offset is used to resume consumption from the correct position.
- **Manual Acknowledgment**: This ensures that messages are processed exactly once by acknowledging them only after successful processing.

### Conclusion

- **Partition**: Use partitions to ensure message order and parallel processing.
- **Offset**: Use offsets for precise control over message consumption, especially for replaying messages or resuming from a specific point.

By combining both, you can achieve robust and reliable message consumption tailored to your application's needs.
